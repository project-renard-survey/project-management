This is our centralized repository for high level, project wide issues.

## Project Management:
We use **ZenHub** to organise our workflows. 
In order to see our full Kanban board and how the EPICs and tasks are connected, [you have to install the plugin here](https://www.zenhub.com/).

But even without Zenhub installed you can check out the tasks here:
  - [High-level tasks/EPICs](https://github.com/WorldBrain/project-management/issues) (i.e Features)
  - [Front-end related tasks](https://github.com/WorldBrain/webmarks/issues) (Webmarks)
  - [Back-end related ](https://github.com/WorldBrain/cortex/issues) (Cortex)
